          <h3>Web Development for Recruitment Program</h3>
          <p>A website for the Recruitment Program was developed in Servicenow platform abiding to the WCAG rules and
            508
            compliances.
            The legacy system was in AWS, Java, Spring, Struts, and Velocity frameworks. The project was to redesign the
            whole website
            and migrate the site to Servicenow Platform. Servicenow is built to manage everything as a service. One of
            the
            biggest
            benefits of ServiceNow is the relatively low amount of configuration required to set up and running in an
            enterprise. </p>

            incident
            reports and
            sent e-mail notification of unusual incidents recorded in camera. Also the application offers a range of
            solutions that
            combines video analytics and IoT technology to deliver business intelligence insights for improving
            performance in sales,
            operations and understanding of customer needs. With the help of NodeJS, ExpressJS and Sequelize ORM server
            side scripting
