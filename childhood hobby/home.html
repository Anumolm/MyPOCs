        Clay Modeling

        <div class="introduction">
            <p>Modeling clay comes in many forms, including polymer and self-hardening, which are often used for making
                fun projects like dishes,
                jewelry, and other crafts. Your kid can easily finish modeling clay craft by play-doh. They are nontoxic
                and say so on the container.
                Unless a child eats a large amount, most modeling clay should not cause serious problems, other than
                possibly some mild diarrhea.
                It is safe to introduce clay modeling to kids. </p>

            <p>Well, in my childhood I used authentic clay. My childhood favorite activity was that.
                Have a look at the images of models I made in my childhod.</p>

            <div class="card">
                <img src="images/kitchenwares.jpg" alt="container set" />
                <div class="container">
                    <h4><b>Kitchenware models</b></h4>
                    <p>These are models of Indian kitchen aids and utensils. These kitchen aids were used in my
                        Grandfathers era and are still at home.
                        I tried to mould them using authentic clay </p>

            <div class="card">
                <img src="images/boat.jpg" alt="boat" />
                <div class="container">
                    <h4><b>Boat model</b></h4>
                    <p>Kerala, southern state of India is famous for waterbodies and hence has plenty of boats.
                        So I tried to prepare its model too. </p>

                    <h4><b>Animal models</b></h4>
                    <p>We had many cattles and goats at home. I loved them so much. So I made their models too. </p>

            <p>The only similarities this modeling clay has to play-doh is that you can mold it.
                This clay is very light and pliable and can be dried. When it dries it does not have the same cracks
                that appear on the play-doh.
                It also does not stick to carpets and food and hair like play-doh does.</p>
