          <p>Steve Jobs, is a hero who rocked the technology industry for years. Let us look into the life of this
            legendary visionary, and learn something from his never-regret journey.</p>

          <h4>1955: The adopted son of Paul Jobs</h4>
          <p>A child was born, and the world didn’t know that this child will change the world. Steve Jobs’ biological
            mother was a young, unwed college graduate, and she decided to put him up for adoption.</p>
          <p>His biological mother later found out that the adoptive mother had never graduated from college and that
            the father was not even graduated from high school. She refused to sign the final adoption papers. She only
            relented a few months later when his adoptive parents promised that he would go to college someday.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-10 mx-auto mt-4">
          <h4>1972: College drop-out</h4>
          <p>The young Jobs graduated from his high school and joined the course at Reed College in Portland, Oregon.
            During the time, Jobs had no idea on what he wanted to do with his life, and he was spending all of the
            money his parents had saved their entire life, so he decided to drop the course after only 1 semester,
            mainly because he could not afford the course.</p>
          <p>The financial difficulties didn’t stop the young man’s passion, he rolled auditing classes at Reed College.
            Since then, he collected and returned Coke bottles just to get himself some food money, and got his weekly
            free meals at the local Hare Krishna temple.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-10 mx-auto mt-4">
          <h4>1972: Jobs’ first job</h4>
          <p>Jobs’ first job was with Hewlett-Packard, as a summer employee. He then took a job as a technician at
            Atari, which was a famous video game manufacturer. He was given a job to create circuit board for the game,
            “Breakout”, and he collaborated with Steve Wozniak, who was later the co-founder of the Apple Company.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-10 mx-auto mt-4">
          <h4>1974: Jobs became a Buddhist</h4>
          <p>Jobs was sparked with the interest of philosophy during his days at Reed College. At the same year he took
            on his first job at Atari, he traveled to Neem Karoli Baba, India with Dan Kottke.</p>
          <p>They went in search of spiritual enlightenment. He came back as a Buddhist, with his head shaved and he was
            wearing traditional Indian clothing.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-10 mx-auto mt-4">
          <h4>1976: Apple Computer was born</h4>
          <p>Many believed Jobs was inspired by Atari’s founder Nolan Bushnell, and the inspiration got him started
            Apple Computer. In 1976, at the age of 21 years old, Steve Jobs founded Apple with his summer job’s
            co-worker at HP, Steve Wozniak, making them the first and second Apple employee.</p>
          <p>The company was later funded by an angel investor, Armas Clifford Markkula, who brought in USD $250,000.

        <div class="col-md-10 mx-auto mt-4">
          <h4>1983: "Sugar water can’t change the world"</h4>
          <p>An uprising year for Apple. The company hired Mike Scott from National Semiconductor to serve as CEO.
            Later, Jobs persuaded John Sculley, who was the CEO of Pepsi-Cola, to serve as Apple’s CEO, with a very
            famous question:

            “Do you want to sell sugar water for the rest of your life, or do you want to come with me and change the
            world?”</p>
          <p>During his days, he helped the Apple to increase its sales from $800 million to $8 billion. In 1987,
            Sculley was Silicon Valley’s highest paid executive, withdrawing USD $2.2 million annually.</p>

          <h4>5th October 2011: The world goes Job-less</h4>
          <p>"The end of a legendary visionary’s journey. His family, in a statement, said Jobs “died peacefully today
            surrounded by his family.”</p>
